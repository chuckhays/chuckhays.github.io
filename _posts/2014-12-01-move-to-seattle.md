After Microsoft [closed]({% post_url 2014-09-23-tcdc %}) the TCDC office, we decided to try something completely different and move out to Seattle! I interviewed a few places and chose a job with Google.

Moving a household with 2 adults and 3 young (4, 2, and 4 weeks) kids is quite a challenge! We loaded up everything we could carry and hopped on an airplane, suddenly there we were.
